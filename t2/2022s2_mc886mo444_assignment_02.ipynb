    " Then, we evaluated the histogram distribuction of the Percentage of correct answers in Portuguese, Mathematics and Natural Sciences Test.With the plots it is possible to conclude that the students perfomed better on Portuguese test, with the percentage in almost 62.5 %. The math test was the test where the students performed worse, with a hit percentage around 50.0 %. In Natural Sciences tests the students had hit percentage around 58.3 %. Comparing the distribution of histograms, it is possible to verify that in the math test that is a greater occurence of lower scores than the other tests.
